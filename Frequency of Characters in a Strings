Program:

def most_frequent(string,freq):
    for i in string:
        if i in freq:
            freq[i]+=1
        else:
            freq[i]=1  
    print("The frequency of each character in the string before sorting is :",str(freq))
          
          
    print("The frequency of each character in string in the descending order is :")

    for i in sorted( freq, key=freq.get , reverse=True):
        print(i,freq[i])
                      
                      
                      
string=input("Enter the string :")
freq={}
most_frequent(string,freq)
    
    
    
 My Output:
    
Enter the string :mississippi
The frequency of each character in the string before sorting is : {'m': 1, 'i': 4, 's': 4, 'p': 2}
The frequency of each character in string in the descending order is :
i 4
s 4
p 2
m 1
s 4
p 2
m 1
